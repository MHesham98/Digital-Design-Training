Write VHDL code and simulate the following design components:

1- Decoder 4_16 </>
2- Decoder 3_8 with enable </>
3- Counter 4 bit with async. reset </>
4- Parallel Register 8 bit with load
5- Shift register 8 bit, with shift left and right
6- Multiplexer 8_1 </>
7- Counter 8 bit with enable </> -- problem of synthisis?
8- DFF with enable </>
9- Counter 4 bit with sync. clear </>
10- 8-bit binary adder</>
11- 4-bit equality comparator </>
12- Counter 4 bit with count up, count down and load initial value controls
